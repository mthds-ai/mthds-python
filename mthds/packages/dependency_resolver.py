    Local path dependencies are resolved directly (no recursion into their sub-deps).
    Remote dependencies are resolved transitively with cycle detection and diamond

    Args:
        manifest: The consuming package's manifest.
        package_root: The root directory of the consuming package.
        cache_root: Override for the package cache root.
        fetch_url_overrides: Map of ``address`` to override clone URL (for tests).

        TransitiveDependencyError: If cycles or unsatisfiable diamonds are found.
